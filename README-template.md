## My process
 Built a container for the whole text semantic. A separate container for image because I think padding is not needed when on a smaller screen size.
 
 Used unordered lists and ordered lists semantics depending on the content, and adjust list properties accordingly. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### Continued development

Continue to do challenges to solidify skills.
